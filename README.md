# Code Creek

A small personal project where I practice frontend development and UI experiments.

This repository is mainly used as a learning playground.  
I try out layouts, components, and different UI ideas here while improving my frontend skills.

## What’s inside

- UI/UX experiments
- Small reusable components
- Layout and styling practice
- Learning-focused implementations

Nothing too fancy — just real practice and iteration.

## Tech stack

- HTML / CSS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

## Purpose

This project is not meant to be a production-ready app.  
It exists to test ideas, improve consistency, and explore frontend patterns.

Some parts may change frequently as I experiment and refactor.

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
